the world and infecting millions of people in worldwide scales. The positive cases amount has also increasing day by day. Covid-19 didn’t just effect socials and cultures
but also effect the economic section, just like cryptocurrencies and the growth of Indonesian’s economical movements. Stocks is a product in the capital market that has 
unpredictable growth. Stocks in pharmacy companies such as Moderna Vaccine Company (ticker name : MRNA), is a biotechnology that has been developing vaccine to cure 
Covid-19 viruses. It has been proved that their research is highly potential as a prevention towards the Covid-19 viruses in the last few weeks. Therefore, we needed a 
methods to analyze how the Moderna Vaccine Company Stock’s growing in the future.</p> 
<p align="justify">The methods in this research are implementing three kinds of Algorithms, that will be used to make the prediction. Those Algorithms i.e. Linear 
Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and ARIMA. All of this models will evaluate the growth of Close Price for Moderna Vaccine company’s stocks for the next 60 days. 
While doing the research, we’ve encountered some problem that will be solved during the discussion process. Those problems i.e. how does the Close price’s growing? How 
about prediction results to predict the Closing price for the next 60 days? What is the finding and value of the accuracy that we get from implementing three different 
algorithm used for predicting the close price for the next 60 days? We have been merging those problem as one as our main target in doing this research.</p>
